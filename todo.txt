Matchmaking by rank/elo
    Temporary solution - implement ability to swap the two players in same role to balance out avg rank/elo
        put a value on each rank/division
    implement func 'auto_matchmaking'!

Once 10 players are in match lobby (i.e. every role is filled in both teams), start game (move match to active matches list)
    implement decline match penalty - todo!
    implement final embed once everyone accepts - done + Multi.gg when game starts - todo
    implement going back to queue when someone declines - done

Figure out a way to verify signup ign
    connect to riot api?

Match history
