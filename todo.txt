If a player is in an active game, cannot queue

Once 10 players are in match lobby (i.e. every role is filled in both teams), start game (move match to active matches list)
    implement decline match 
    implement final embed once everyone accepts
    implement going back to queue when someone declines

Matchmaking by rank/elo
    Temporary solution - implement ability to swap the two players in same role

Accept number cannot go below 0

Use LoL ign instead of discord name

Implement !win command

When a player signs up, save the data permanently - in a json?

Clean up class functions
