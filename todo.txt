Time limit to accepting match - must test that it works in alpha testing
    Debug with waitlist_queue, add_player_to_queue,accept/decline,update_ui functions *******

Matchmaking by rank/elo
    Temporary solution - implement ability to swap the two players in same role to balance out avg rank/elo
        put a value on each rank/division
    implement func 'auto_matchmaking'!
        if no inhouse data, will use soloq mmr
        after good number of inhouse games, use inhouse 'elo'

Once 10 players are in match lobby (i.e. every role is filled in both teams), start game (move match to active matches list)
    implement decline match penalty - todo!
    implement final embed once everyone accepts - done + Multi.gg when game starts - todo
        players need to put their tag in their ign
    implement going back to queue when someone declines - TODO WITH TIME LIMIT ***

MAJOR FIXES BEFORE BETA test
    - Finding rank using Riot API does not work if not enough ranked games (esp early in season 2024)
    - uses previous ign instead of Riot ign
    - check decline/unqueue



Update playerinfo since soloq rank can change (therefore mmr changes)

Match history
    todo, far future + need tourney code
