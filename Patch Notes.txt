EDGE CASES FOR UNQUEUE/DECLINE/waitlist_queue
    - first person to respond to match found declines
    - couple people accept, then one declines
    - queue from waitlist (remove the player from the waitlist?)

Matchmaking by rank/elo
    Temporary solution - implemented ability to swap the two players in same role to balance out avg rank/elo
        put a value on each rank/division

MAJOR FIXES 
    - Finding rank using Riot API does not work if not enough ranked games (esp early in season 2024) - fixed
    - uses previous ign instead of Riot ign - fixed
    - penalty to decline - ON HOLD

Update playerinfo since soloq rank can change (therefore mmr changes) - will be once a month
